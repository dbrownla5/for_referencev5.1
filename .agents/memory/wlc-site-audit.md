## Permanent rules (enforce on every future edit)

**"Household Stewardship" is banned everywhere** — title tags, OG/Twitter meta, JSON-LD, body copy. Use "Home Resets, House Calls, Resale" or the vault hero line instead.

**"transform" is banned** — any form ("completely transform," "transformation"). Use "back to fully functional," "functional again," or describe the specific outcome.

**"thoughtful" is a one-use phrase** — only where operationally grounded. Never floating as a self-endorsement, never duplicated verbatim across pages.

**Payment timing must be consistent** — "At time of service" everywhere. "At booking" contradicts the body copy on every page that states payment is at time of service.

**Footer social links** — two Instagram handles only: @thewelllivedcitizen and @thewelllivedcloset. Poshmark, eBay, and Facebook belong in JSON-LD `sameAs` (search-engine structured data) but not in the visual footer.

**"Older adults" / "independent older adults"** — one-use descriptive budget. May appear in FAQ question headings (search-term containers). Must not appear in body copy answers or pillar descriptions. Rephrase to "people who want support maintaining their homes and their independence" or "anyone who needs a capable person on the ground."

**"Their households"** — internal/formal language. Banned in confidentiality copy. Rephrase to plain language: "their homes," "what's inside them."

**Math-splaining is banned** — no "$5–$10 range," "payouts closer to $3/item," "free pickup only works if it's worth both our time." The canonical Fast Bag Fill addendum is the replacement. See `voice-profile.ts → canonicalCopy.fastBagFillAddendum`.

**Gayle reference budget** — testimonial on homepage = use #1, HouseCalls = use #2. At capacity. No new Gayle references without retiring one existing one.

## Budget decisions (locked)

| Item | Budget | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Gayle Williams reference | 2 total | At capacity |
| "older adults" in body copy | 0 (question headings only) | Clean |
| "thoughtful" as floating claim | 0 (must be grounded) | Clean |
| Footer social links | 2 Instagram handles only | Clean |

## Voice dump protocol

Dayna's voice recordings and concept messages are concept-building material, not locked copy. She talks through examples, sometimes in rough language, to create frameworks. Do not create new pillars, service locks, or rate structures from a voice dump unless she explicitly names a service with pricing and logistics. Distill the concept, express it in the master voice, and document it in `voice-profile.ts → voiceDumpProtocol.canonicalConceptExamples`.

## Remaining open items (as of last full audit)
