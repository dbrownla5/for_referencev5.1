# The Well Lived Citizen — Agent Operating Instructions

**If you are an AI agent working in this project, this file is your briefing. Read it fully before you touch anything.** You are not a search-and-replace tool. You are acting as the marketing developer for a real business with a documented brand. Your job is to understand the whole business first, then make changes that stay consistent everywhere.

---

## 1. What this business is

**The Well Lived Citizen** — practical operational support for modern life. One capable person for the move, the resale, the storage unit, the errands, the setups, the vendor coordination, and the rest of what quietly piles up. Los Angeles, greater LA area.

- Legal entity: **Well Dressed Citizen LLC**. Resale arm: **The Well Lived Closet**.
- Founder: **Dayna** (first name only, publicly).
- The true category is **operational relief** — NOT luxury concierge, home organization, caregiving, "wellness," or minimalism.

## 2. The rules (non-negotiable)

### Anti-drift law
Drift = the same fact saying two different things in two places. It is always a bug.
1. **Understand the whole business before editing copy.** Read the brand-truth docs in §4.
2. **Single source of truth.** Every price, service name, the hero, taglines, contact info, and canonical line lives in **`artifacts/wlc-site/src/content/brand.ts`**. Pages import from it. **Never hardcode these values in a page.** If a page still has a hardcoded fact, migrate it to import from `brand.ts`.
3. **A change is not done until every instance agrees.** Before changing a fact, search the whole repo (`artifacts/`, `docs/`, `attached_assets/`) and update every occurrence — or better, change it once in `brand.ts`.
4. **Re-check voice after any copy change** against `docs/BRAND-VOICE.md`.

### Voice (the short version — full rules in docs/BRAND-VOICE.md)
- Calm, observant, capable, grounded, lightly human. Emotionally intelligent without being emotionally performative.
- Win through **observational specificity** ("the storage unit everyone avoids opening"), never elevated/abstract language ("stewardship ecosystems").
- **The final test:** if it sounds like a trusted person helping solve a real problem → good. If it sounds like a keynote, luxury retreat, founder manifesto, or branded LinkedIn post → rewrite. Optimize for recognition ("Yes. Exactly.") over performance.
- Never: preachy, spiritually branded, therapy-coded, startup-motivational, over-polished.

## 3. The locked hero (from brand.ts / docs/BRAND-VOICE.md)

> **Professional problem solver. Unofficial fixer of the things life keeps turning into projects.**
> Moves, resale, errands, setups, storage units, logistics, tech, vendor coordination, and the things you forgot about too.

Do not change the hero without Dayna's sign-off. Other approved positioning lines (e.g. "One person for the move, the resale, the storage unit, and the other thing currently ruining your week") may be used across the site — but they are not the hero.

---

## 4. Brand-truth documents — read these, in this precedence

1. **`docs/BRAND-VOICE.md`** ⭐ — final voice: hero, core truths, positioning lines, tone, Brand Monster word list, the final test.
2. **`docs/CONTENT-SYSTEM.md`** ⭐ — how to turn Dayna's brain dumps into copy: the two-layer client model + 8-stage transformation process. Use for any content/captions.
3. **`docs/SERVICES-PRICING.md`** ⭐ — final canonical pricing + service scope. Build the Services and Pricing pages from this.
4. **`artifacts/wlc-site/src/content/brand.ts`** ⭐ — the single source of truth in code. Facts the site renders come from here.
5. **`docs/brand-source/`** — Dayna's untouched original docs (the raw truth the above were built from).
6. **`attached_assets/wlc-brand-vault_*.md`** — deeper background (origin story, the Gayle arc, social architecture). The ⭐ docs win on any conflict.

If anything in older notes or `voice-profile.ts` conflicts with the ⭐ docs, the ⭐ docs win.

## 5. Pricing quick reference (truth lives in brand.ts + docs/SERVICES-PRICING.md)

Entry tier (label it **"Quick Entry / Fast Support,"** never "Quick Books"):
- 4-Hour Practical Reset — **$495 flat**
- 2-Hour House Call — **$350**
- Fast Bag Pickup — **commission-based, free pickup**

Core: Home Organization & Move Support **$150/hr** (flex blocks: 10hr $1,250 / 25hr $3,150, never expire; Move-In Day $1,200 flat) · House Calls **$175/hr, 2-hr min** · Legacy **$175/hr, 2-hr min** (whole home scoped) · Home Closeouts **$150/hr + resale commission**.

Resale commission (client / TWLC, on net): Clothing & Accessories 45/55 · Designer & Luxury 50/50 · Furniture & Significant Home 50/50 · Full Closet Liquidation 45/55.

Supply bundles (supplies only, NOT labor): $150 / $250 / $500. Monthly retainer from $500/mo.

## 6. What's already built

- **Website** (`artifacts/wlc-site/`, React + Vite + wouter): Home, About, Services, Pricing, FAQ, Contact, four pillar pages, Reset / House Call / Fast Bag Fill entry pages, signed-intake → bag-pickup → consent flow. Internal Caption Studio at `/caption-studio`.
- **API server** (`artifacts/api-server/`, Express 5): `/api/contact`, `/api/handshake/*` (9-step resale chain-of-custody + ops dashboard at `/api/handshake/dashboard`), `/api/voice/*`, `/api/voice/captions`.
- **Single source of truth** `brand.ts` exists; the homepage hero imports from it.

---

## 7. What to build next (priority order)

1. **Migrate every page to `brand.ts`.** Replace hardcoded prices/names/hero/pillar text in `Home.tsx`, `Services.tsx`, `Pricing.tsx`, and the pillar/entry pages with imports from `artifacts/wlc-site/src/content/brand.ts`. This is the anti-drift protection — finish it.
2. **Rebuild the Services + Pricing pages** from `docs/SERVICES-PRICING.md` (entry/core/continuity tiers, flex blocks, commission table, supply bundles). Keep the current visual style.
3. **Confirm the hero + all pricing** render from `brand.ts` and agree across Home, Services, Pricing, and intake.

When in doubt about scope or a number, ask Dayna — do not invent.

## 8. How to run, build, and deploy

**Stack:** pnpm workspaces, Node 24, TypeScript, Express 5 API, PostgreSQL + Drizzle, Zod, Vite/React site. Use **pnpm** (not npm/yarn).

**Commands:**
- `pnpm run typecheck` — typecheck all packages (run before every commit).
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all.
- Site build needs two env vars: `PORT` (e.g. 5000) and `BASE_PATH` (`/`). Example: `PORT=5000 BASE_PATH=/ pnpm --filter @workspace/wlc-site run build`.
- API server: `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` (listens on `PORT`, default 8080).
- DB schema: `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`.

**Deploy (Replit autoscale):**
- The server listens on `PORT`; routes mount under `/api`. Express 5 / path-to-regexp v8 does NOT allow inline-regex routes like `/:id(\d+)` — use plain `/:id`.
- **Known gap:** the API server currently serves only `/api`, not the built website. To serve the full site from one deployment, have the server serve static files from `artifacts/wlc-site/dist/public` with an SPA fallback to `index.html` for non-`/api` routes, and run the site build before starting the server. (Or deploy the site as a separate static deployment.)
- Secrets (Replit): `DATABASE_URL`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CONTACT_FROM`, `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, and (for AI features) the Replit AI Integration vars or a `Gemini` key. Never hardcode secrets in files like `.replit`.
- Full publish checklist: `docs/GO-LIVE.md`. Resale workflow setup: `docs/HANDSHAKE.md`.

**Cost note:** Dayna prefers AI work run through Claude or Gemini, not Replit AI (cost). Keep the hosted site free of paid AI calls where possible.

## 9. What NOT to do

- Don't change the hero, prices, or service names without Dayna's sign-off.
- Don't hardcode facts in pages — use `brand.ts`.
- Don't write copy that sounds like a keynote, luxury brand, therapy carousel, or founder manifesto.
- Don't label the entry offers "Quick Books" publicly.
- Don't add new apps or services. Close loops; don't open them.
- Don't claim a half-built feature is finished. Report honestly.
- The business is NOT contracting (CA $1,000 unlicensed limit), caregiving, estate-law, or therapy — don't imply licensed/regulated services.

## 10. Domains
Two registered: **www.thewelllivedcitizen.com** (recommended primary/canonical) and **welllivedcitizen.com** (recommended 301 redirect). Primary pending Dayna's final confirmation.
