/**
 * Email module — Resend with a graceful fallback.

 * If RESEND_API_KEY is set, mail is sent via Resend. If it is not set, the app
 * does NOT crash and does NOT lose the message: the email is logged in full and
 * the function reports `delivered: false`. This lets the system be hosted and
 * exercised end-to-end before email is switched on, then "just work" once the
 * key is added — no code change.
