    fastBagFillAddendum: `Honest note before you book: Fill the bag with whatever's been sitting there — you don't have to know what anything's worth, that's on me.

Fast Bag Fill is for clothes, shoes, and accessories with a real resale buyer out there, and it's free because the value comes from the sale.

If your bag is mostly everyday things that won't bring much back, resale isn't the lane that helps you — you'd wait on a cycle that pays out next to nothing. What you actually want is a Reset or a House Call. I come in, sort the whole thing, set aside anything worth listing, and handle the donation run myself, same day. That's the move when the goal is gone and handled rather than sold.

Not sure which one you've got? Send a photo. I'll point you to the right one before you book.`,

    valueRecoveryPhilosophy: `Not everything should be donated. Not everything should be sold. And not everything should be decided in a moment of pressure.

This work creates thoughtful pathways for what remains useful, meaningful, insurable, valuable, or simply too important to leave to chance.`,

    canonicalPillarDescriptions: {
      theReset: `The Reset is the relief of the room. Not just the closet — the storage unit, the baby shower gifts still in boxes, the space that stopped working and is now just something you walk past. It can be any space. A four-hour working session: sort, edit, place, and route — starting the moment I arrive.`,

      legacyInventory: `Legacy Inventory is the relief of the life in the hidden things. Most families don't know what they have until it's too late to ask. This work is the process of finding out — assigning value, story, and meaning to the things a life accumulates, and making a plan while there's still time to choose how it goes. Proactive or urgent. Room by room. Object by object.`,

      houseCalls: `House Calls is the person you used to be able to call. The partner who kept track of all the passwords. The neighbor who knew who to hire. The best friend who just came over and figured it out with you. That is the role — practical, available, and capable. Anyone can book it: for yourself, for a parent, for someone who needs a person on the ground.`,

      curatedResale: `Resale flows from everything else. Reset the closet and what you're editing out gets listed. Do Legacy work and the storage unit gets loaded and sold. Close out a move and you ship what you keep and sell the rest. It doesn't have to be its own separate project — it's already built into the other work. Commission-based, pickup included, platform-matched by category.`,
