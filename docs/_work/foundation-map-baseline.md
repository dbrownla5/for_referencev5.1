## Do / Don’t Use Rules (pattern-derived)

### Do
- Do treat every source as evidence and reconcile in the ledger first.
- Do extract by chronology before choosing what survives.
- Do link copy decisions to implementation paths (page/module/API), not just docs.
- Do keep one canonical location per fact in code constants where applicable.
- Do log non-use reasons immediately (duplicate, unresolved conflict, missing runtime path, or drift risk).

### Don’t
- Don’t treat “final/locked” wording as auto-authority without lineage check.
- Don’t merge copy or tool fragments without a source/date/context record.
- Don’t keep duplicate deploy paths untagged; they create silent non-use.
- Don’t close a wave without documenting what was intentionally not adopted and why.

## Glossary

- **Evidence:** any source artifact (doc/code/audit) treated as input, not final authority.
- **Phase:** chronology bucket used to preserve sequence when extracting material.
- **Readiness:** how close a fragment is to immediate reuse (`High`, `Medium`, `Partial`).
- **Integration cost:** relative effort to connect a fragment into the active lane (`Low`, `Medium`).
- **Drift risk:** facts or copy diverging across files without a reconciled canonical reference.
